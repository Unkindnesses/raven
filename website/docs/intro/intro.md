Welcome the *The Grimoire*, the complete guide to the Raven programming language. Raven is an expressive functional language that feels as breezy as a scripting tool. It is interactive, with support for notebooks and live coding, yet it can scale to the most ambitious projects via powerful error checking, great editor support, and robust debugging. Better yet, Raven compiles to fast [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) code, meaning it works in the browser and can be used to publish interactive reports and documentation.

The Grimoire is itself an interactive Raven program. The spells, incantations and wonders within can be enjoyed from the comfort of your browser.

```raven
# Edit me!
println("Hello, World!")
```

## Reading this Guide

This guide is written like a book, starting with the basics and gradually building up ideas, and can be read end-to-end if you'd like. The early Foundations section makes few assumptions about programming knowledge; more advanced programmers will probably find they can skim it quickly to get an idea of syntax, or even pick this up as they go in later sections. After the basics the topics covered are largely independent, so you should feel free to dip in and out of different areas that interest you.

## Other Resources
